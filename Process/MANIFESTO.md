# 2018-01-03 11:58, in which Manifesto 00

I'm going to try again to write a series of manifestos over the life of this project. A huge amount of what I've been grappling with over in the process journal has been effectively about the fundamental philosophy of this project, which I think I would like trying to call its manifesto in keeping with Tassos and Kony.

I tried to do this in _Sibilant Snakelikes_ and wrote precisely one manifesto like half-way or more through the project. Let's see if we can at least write two? It would be a way of understanding my understanding of what the project is and what it means. So.

__Manifesto 00__

0. I want to have a conversation with Unity about games and game design.
1. "_Unity, what are games made of?_", I ask.
2. Unity is a highly structured being and you need a highly structured way of talking to it without getting lost.
3. Unity would like to talk about its fundamental beliefs about the ontology of a game.
4. Unity thinks that games are made out of GameObjects and that there are specific kinds of GameObjects that are the most important one, listed in the GameObject menu.
5. I open the GameObject menu. "_This is what games are made of._", says Unity. Lights, Cameras, 3D Objects, Particle Systems, and so on.
6. I want to talk to Unity about its GameObjects and what they mean.
7. To talk to Unity you have to make things with it. This is then a "conversation with materials". This is design. This is what Donald Sch√∂n's _reflective practitioner_ engages in.
8. Just making "anything" is too broad to survive.
9. I can jump start my conversation with Unity by starting with an existing game, _TANKS!_ and modifying it in order to discuss the ontology GameObjects.
10. To have a good conversation about a specific kind of GameObject I'll need to make more than one modification. We need to talk about the GameObject from different perspectives, talk about its different uses and potentials.
11. Using the _TANKS!_ tutorial game is another way of specifically talking to _Unity itself_ because the tutorial was literally made by _Unity-the-company_ to teach _Unity-the-software_.
12. Using the _TANKS!_ tutorial game is also a way of talking about game design in a specific way because it represents a kind of _Ur game_: two entities shooting each other in a delineated space. See: Atari _Combat_. See: _Spacewar!_. See: every shooting game ever. "_Unity, we need to talk about all this violence._"
13. "_I'm listening._"
